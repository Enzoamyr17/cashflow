## What's Still Needed

Before first use, you must:

2. âœ… Run database migrations
3. âœ… Add environment variables
4. âœ… Create at least one category (now easy with the new UI!)

## Known Limitations

1. **Deleting categories**: When a category is deleted, existing transactions with that category will have `category_id` set to null (appears as "Uncategorized")
2. **Category colors**: Limited to 8 preset colors (can be expanded in the future)
3. **Category editing**: Currently no edit functionality - users must delete and recreate
